# Meetings

Currently, we meet at regular intervals for different purposes:  



- Mondays 09:30-10:00: weekly stand-up
- Thursdays 11.00-12.00: weekly lab meeting
- Thursdays 16.00-17.00: skills meeting or coffee moment
- Every 6 weeks on Tuesday (16:00): journal club  



## Attending our meetings

The current meeting schedule with open meetings can be found [here](https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/s/nRDFO4yc8ZPGZSp).  

If you would like to attend one of our meetings as attendee or guest speaker, please feel free to send us an email via [synclab@essb.eur.nl](mailto:synclab@essb.eur.nl) or contact [Eduard Klapwijk](https://www.eur.nl/people/eduard-klapwijk). 



## Stand-up

The weekly stand-up is meant to keep each other up to date on our work (and sometimes personal) activities and to ask for help when needed. We all shortly state what we are doing and note whether or not we have something we need help with.  



## Labmeetings

In the labmeetings, labmembers or external visitors share their latest results or ideas for new research. It is a great opportunity to get feedback in a supportive and welcoming environment. Lab meetings can also be used to practice a (conference) talk.

Collaborators from outside the SYNC lab are more than welcome for labmeetings where research from the specific collaboration is discussed. So do not forget to invite your collaborators when presenting!  



## Skills meetings

The skills meeting is a one-hour opportunity to work on a diversity of skills that can be useful for a researcher. Labmembers can introduce information on a certain skill or topic or can help to dive deeper in a topic where most have already some experience with.
In this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RKIx5xdfvvjomPJ-rH_jyMNGn6oHWyi3PPTI0mwt6vk/edit#gid=0) we identified skills and topics:  

- labmembers have some experience or expertise  
- labmembers want to learn more about  

As you can see in the sheet, these skills can focus on methods, but also on personal and artistic topics. Ideally, we would work on topics that align with the ambitions of the SYNC lab: 

- _World-class Science_
- _Open Science_
- _Citizen Science_


Since the skills meetings are only one hour a week, most of the times it would be just an introduction to a certain topic. It would be great to go from there and dive deeper in certain topics in smaller groups when interested (e.g., while working on a project together).
For topics where we have less expertise in the lab, we invite experts from outside the lab.  


## Journal clubs

Every 6 weeks, we aim to have a journal club about a specific topic, focused on theoretical and methodological papers. This allows us to dive deeper into theoretical aspects of our work and remain up to date with current literature. Example topics from the past are theories on social media in adolescence and the importance of effect sizes in scientific research.  



### Open Science Community Rotterdam workshops

For Open Science related topics, it is also an option to reach a broader audience and organise a workshop for the Open Science Community Rotterdam. All lab members can take part in these workshops as well, and other researchers can then also enjoy our expertise and experience.
See the [OSCR website](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/categories/news/) for a list of previous and upcoming workshops. Two lab members have already given a workshop:

- Eduard: Introduction to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), [workshop description](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/09/intro-bids-sept2020/)
- Dorien: Introduction to sharing brain MRI data, [workshop description](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/10/sharing-mri-oct2020/)
